=======
If you are new to the topic of servers and do not know how to start it, I have two options for you

1-From the folder

For this you must enter the server folder and holding Shift + right click a list of options will open, you will click "open command window here".

The command window will open in which you must write the following: "java -jar (server file name). jar"

Examples:

Java -jar paper-1.12.2-1620.jar

With Custom Ram:

java -Xmx1000M -Xms1000M -jar paper-1.12.2-1620.jar

Note: The RAM to dedicate will depend on how much the computer has (Recommended to use half or less of the PC's ram)

2-Create an executable (Windows)

For this you will have to create a text file and inside it paste this code:

@echo off
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Xmx1000M -Xms1000M -jar (server filename).jar
pause

Then you will give it to save and in the name of the file you will put something like: Start.bat (it is important to always place the .bat at the end)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: all the ways to start the server is taking into account that you will do it from your pc, in hosters they are different methods depending on each host
