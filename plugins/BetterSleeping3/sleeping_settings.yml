# Choose an option from below (percentage or absolute)
# With percentage, a relative amount of players needs to sleep (eg. needed: 30 -> 13 online players, 30% of 13 is 3,9. Will be rounded to the nearest number -> 4 sleeping players needed)
# With absolute, a set amount of players needs to sleep (eg. needed: 2 -> any amount of online players, 2 players need to sleep)
